**Why to study Blockchain?**

- It is a disruptive technology, i.e,it has the power to change a traditional approach into a new enhanced technology.
- It has gained trust of people after financial crisis of USA in the year 2008.

**What is Blockchain?**

Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledger which is completely transparent.

**Application of Blockchain**

- Product Tracking
- Smart Contract
- International Wire Transfer
- Healthcare System

**Hashing Algorithm**

- Each block is identified by it's own unique **_hash_**.Each block also stores hash of the previous block known as **_prev hash_**.Prev hash of the first block(genesis block) is always _0_.
- Hashing is done using **_SHA256_** algorithm.The entered data is encrypted using this algorithm.It has 64 hexadecimal chahracters each of 4 bits.So,in total it has 64\*4=256 bits.

* Five requirements of hashing algorithm are as follows:
